I created this plugin, because we wanted to add a commercial post (Advertorial) to multiple sites. With this plugin you can do this by checking the sites you want the post on.
It will add an option on the postedit page, like the screenshot, where you can choose the sites want to post it on.

    Current features:

	* Uncheck to delete the post from site
